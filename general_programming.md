### General Programming

* Static vs Dynamic programming languages?
    * Static programming language
      * Before running the data type of each variable is checked.
      * Done by a compiler.
      * Invalid assignments give compile-error.
      * eg. C++

    * Dynamic programming languages
      * Data types are known only after running the programme.
      * Runtime errors.
      * eg. Python

* Duck typing
    * Dynamic languages 

#### Memory 

* Where are the stack and a heap memory stored?
   * RAM 

* Stack vs Heap
   * Stack 
      * Small contiguous blocks of memory.
      * Each thread has its own stack.
      * Local variables are stored.
      * Scope: function start to end.
      * Error: Stack overflow.

   * Heap
      * Large fragmented memory. 
      * All threads have access to common heap memory.
      * Scope: application start to end.
      * Error: Out of memory.
