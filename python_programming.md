### Python Programming

* How is random implemented in python? 
  * 

* Datastructure implementations:
  * set 
  * map
  * list 

* Are there pointers in python?

* Immutable vs Mutable datastructures?

* Sort implementations in python?

* Garbage collector in python?  

* Python magic methods?
  * Special methods in a python class.
  * __init__, __new__, __add__ etc.
  * Used for operator overloading.

* Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)

* Deep copy vs Shallow copy

* Type Introspection and Reflection
  * Type Introspection
    * Ability of the program to examine its type at runtime.
    * type()
  * Reflection
    * Uses type introspection.
    * Uses it to change properties of object at runtime.
    * Use cases :
      * As part of software testing, such as for the runtime creation/instantiation of mock objects.
      * Deserializing, serialization 
    * getattr()
