* Homogeneous transformation

* Types of Transformations?
  1. Affine transformation
  2. Projective transformation
  3. 

* Isotropic vs Non-Isotropic scaling
  * Isotraopic scaling
    * Same scaling factor along width and height. 
    * ie. Maintains Aspect ratio
  * Non-Isotropic scaling 
    * Uses different scaling factor along width and height.
    * ie. Dosn't maintains aspect ratio

* Ideal points
  * Points where parallel lines meet at infinity in homogeneous coordinate systems.
  * (x,y,0) --> in homogeneous coordinates

* Homogeneous coordinate into Eucledian coordinate system
  * 
  * Converting from a homogeneous coordinates to a conventional one is unique; but, converting a conventional coordinates to a homogeneous one is not. 
  * (x,y) in the xy-plane is (xw, yw, w) for any non-zero w. (Non-unique)

* Duality
