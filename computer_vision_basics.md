### Feature extraction
* Different Feature extraction algorithms:
  * Corner detection
    * Harris corner
    * Shiâ€“Tomasi
  * 

### Tracking [1]

* Main components of visual tracking
  * Target initialization (Bounding box)
  * Appearance modeling (Feature extraction)
  * Motion model 
    * Motion estimation
    * Motion update

* Types of visual tracking
  * Meanshift and Cam shift 
  * Lukas Kanade 
  * Convolution based (Go-turn)

* Types of Optical flow:
  * Sparse optical flow
  * Dense optical flow   

* Optical flow working
  *  2D vector field where each vector is a displacement vector showing the movement of points from first frame to second.
