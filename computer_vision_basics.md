  <summary> Hough transform </summary>

  * Method to find shape in the image.
  * Uses polar coordinates. 
  * Accumulator : 
  * General steps :
    1. Extract edges in image
    2. Choose desired transformations
    3. Iterate through image and populate the accumulator 
    4. Search local maximum values in accumulator space

### Tracking [1]

* Main components of visual tracking
  * Target initialization (Bounding box)
  * Appearance modeling (Feature extraction)
  * Motion model 
    * Motion estimation
    * Motion update

* Types of visual tracking
  * Meanshift and Cam shift 
  * Lukas Kanade 
  * Convolution based (Go-turn)

* Types of Optical flow:
  * Sparse optical flow
  * Dense optical flow   

* Optical flow working
  *  2D vector field where each vector is a displacement vector showing the movement of points from first frame to second.
